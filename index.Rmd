## Owen Page's Webpage
  Hello, my name is Owen Page. I am a senior undergraduate at UVM studying biology, and I currently work in the Janssen-Heininger lab in the Pathology Department. Also in association with the Vermont Lung Center, our lab focuses on redox biology and lung diseases such as Ideopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis, mild to severe allergic or obesity-induced asthma, and non-small cell lung cancer.We specifically focus on the effects of S-glutathionylation within the lungs. 

  My research is specifically focused on allergin-induced asthma via a house dust mite model. I am interested in the role of JNK1, a MAP Kinase, in exacerbating an asthmatic system and leading to more severe asthma in which tissue remodeling may begin to occur via an epithelial to mesenchymal shift of cells.
