## Pathogenesis of Allergic Asthma.

- Th2 polarized immune response
- IL-4/IL-13 phosphorylate STAT6 leading to Th2 cell activation
- Characterized by a IgE to IgM antibody shift
- result of repeated injury and repair

## Pulmonary Remodeling

## Introduction of key players

>- JNK1
>- \color{gray} IL-13
>- \color{red} STAT6
>- \color{gray} IL-33 
>- \color{black} Hypothesis: Epithelial JNK1 drives  airway remodeling via regulating IL-33 induced IL-13- expression and resultant downstream phosphorylation of STAT6.


## Hypothesis figures


> - 1) Model of pathway
> - 2) role of IL-33 on non-epithelial cell secretion
